# Simplified README for Full-Stack Project

This project consists of a **React frontend (FE)** and a **Flask backend (BE)**. The goal is to develop a full-stack web application for task automation, file uploads, and status monitoring.

---

## **Workflow**

### **Frontend (React)**
- Developed using Node.js and npm.
- Runs on `http://localhost:3000`.
- Interacts with the backend via RESTful APIs.

### **Backend (Flask)**
- Developed using Python and Flask.
- Runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
- Provides endpoints for APIs like health checks and chat interactions.

### **How They Work Together**
- The React frontend fetches data from the Flask backend via API endpoints (e.g., `/health`).
- The backend processes requests and returns responses, enabling dynamic behavior in the frontend.

---

## **Tools**

- **Frontend Development**: Use **VS Code** to manage and run the React frontend.
- **Backend Development**: Use **PyCharm** to manage and run the Flask backend.
- **API Testing**: Use tools like Postman, curl, or browser for testing endpoints.

## **Preferences**

### **General Preferences**
1. **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
   - Instructions should be provided **one step at a time** so you can follow and complete them in real-time.

2. **Terminology**:
   - Refer to the **backend** as **"BE"**.
   - Refer to the **frontend** as **"FE"**.

3. **File Downloads**:
   - Use descriptive names for downloadable files (e.g., `readme.md`, `features.md`) without unnecessary prefixes like "updated."

4. **Task Context**:
   - Specify whether a task or command applies to the BE (backend in PyCharm) or the FE (frontend in VS Code) to avoid confusion.

### **Markdown Preferences**
1. **Preview**:
   - Use **VS Code** for `.md` files and preview them with `Ctrl + Shift + V` (Markdown Preview).
   - Open Markdown Preview automatically if possible.
