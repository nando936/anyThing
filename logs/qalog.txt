**Question:**  
> Is there a way I can compare the stiles and rails of a door in a job to the template that door was built from and note any differences between them? I swear I saw a table in the databases somewhere that stored door template information, but now I can't find anything of the sort. I wanna be able to note on my door list if the door frame has been changed from the default without having to make a drawing.
