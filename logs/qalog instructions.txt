# Q&A Log Instructions

## Purpose:
The Q&A Log is used to document questions and answers found online or elsewhere in a consistent, clear, and structured format for easy reference and analysis.

## Formatting Guidelines:

1. **Structure:**  
   Each question and its answer must follow this format:
   ```

   [Insert date when the information was logged]

   **Question Author:**  
   [Insert the name of the question author]

   **Question Asked On:**  
   [Insert the date when the question was originally asked]

   **Question Link:**  
   [Insert the URL or reference link where the question was found]

   **Question Tags:**  
   #[Insert tags, e.g., #CabinetVision, #Customization]

   **Question:**  
   > [Insert the question text here]

   **Answer Author:**  
   [Insert the name of the person who answered]

   **Answer Provided On:**

   ```

2. **Code Block Usage:**  
   - Ensure the Q&A log entry is fully enclosed in a `code block` for easy copying.
   - **DO NOT** include any of ChatGPT's responses inside the code block.
   - All instructions, explanations, or prompts must be outside the code block.

3. **Dividers:**  
   Each entry must be separated by a horizontal rule (`---`) to clearly distinguish it from others.

## Field Descriptions and Prompts:

1. **Date Found:**  
   - Use the current date when the log entry is created.

2. **Question Author:**  
   - Enter the name of the question author.
   - If not provided, prompt: **"Who is the author of the question?"**

3. **Question Asked On:**  
   - Enter the date when the question was originally asked.
   - If the source specifies a relative time (e.g., "1 month ago", "2 days ago", "5 minutes ago"), calculate the date based on the current date:
     - For days, subtract the specified number of days.
     - For months, subtract 30 days for each month.
     - For hours or minutes, convert them to fractions of a day (e.g., 1 hour = 1/24 day, 30 minutes = 1/48 day).
     - Use these conversions to estimate the exact date and format it as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - If not provided, prompt: **"When was the question asked?"**

4. **Question Link:**  
   - Include the link to the source of the question.
   - If unavailable, prompt: **"Do you have a link to the source of the question?"**

5. **Question Tags:**  
   - Add 2â€“3 relevant tags summarizing the topic.
   - If the tags are unclear, prompt: **"What tags would best describe this question?"**

6. **Question:**  
   - Paste the question text exactly as found, formatted as a blockquote (`> `).

   - Enter the name of the person who answered.
   - If not provided, prompt: **"Who is the author of the answer?"**

8. **Answer Provided On:**  
   - Enter the date when the answer was provided.
   - If the source specifies a relative time (e.g., "2 months ago", "3 days ago", "10 minutes ago"), calculate the date based on the current date:
     - For days, subtract the specified number of days.
     - For months, subtract 30 days for each month.
     - For hours or minutes, convert them to fractions of a day (e.g., 1 hour = 1/24 day, 30 minutes = 1/48 day).
     - Use these conversions to estimate the exact date and format it as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - If not provided, prompt: **"When was the answer provided?"**

9. **Answer Source:**  
   - Add the URL or reference link where the answer was found.
   - If the answer is from the same source as the question, note: **"Same as Question Link."**

10. **Answer:**  
   - Paste the answer text exactly as found, formatted as a blockquote (`> `).

## Prompting for Missing Information:
- Prompt the user for missing fields one at a time.
- Ensure the prompt is specific to the missing field (e.g., "Do you have a link to the source of the question?").
- After the user provides the information, update the log and move to the next missing field.

## Final Note:
- Always ensure the Q&A log entry is clean, accurate, and formatted properly.
- Any additional instructions or adjustments must be discussed and agreed upon before applying changes.
